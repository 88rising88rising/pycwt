Continuous wavelet transform module for Python. Includes a collection
of routines for wavelet transform and statistical analysis via FFT
algorithm. This module references to the numpy, scipy and pylab Python
packages.

The sample script (sample.py) illustrates the use of the wavelet and
inverse wavelet transforms and the results are plotted in a figure
similar to the sample_nino3.png image file.

DISCLAIMER
    This module is based on routines and data provided by C. Torrence
    and G. Compo available at http://paos.colorado.edu/research/wavelets/
    and on routines provided by A. Brazhe available at
    http://cell.biophys.msu.ru/static/swan/.

    This software may be used, copied, or redistributed as long as it
    is not sold and this copyright notice is reproduced on each copy
    made. This routine is provided as is without any express or implied
    warranties whatsoever.

INSTALLATION
    Copy all the contents into a location included in the Python search
    path. On Linux distribution one such option is

        ~/.local/lib/python2.x/site-packages/kPyWavelet

TODO
    Considering that the provided code works properly, the following
    steps are to include the cross-wavelet transform and wavelet
    coherence into the module.

COMMENTS
    There is an errata page at the wavelet website maintaned at the Program 
    in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder, 
    Colorado, wich was (is) accessible throught the link

    Errata
    ~~~~~~    
    - Figure 3: N/(2 sigma^2) should just be N/sigma^2.
    - Equation (17), left-hand side: Factor of 1/2 should be removed.
    - Table 1, DOG, Psi-hat (third column, bottom row): Should be a minus sign 
      in front of the equation.
    - Sec 3f, last paragraph: Plugging N=506, dt=1/4 yr, s0=2dt, and dj=0.125 
      into Eqn (10) actually gives J=64, not J=56 as stated in the text.
      However, in Figure 1b, the scales are only plotted out to J=56 since the
      power is so low at larger scales.

    (DOF = degrees of freedom)

    Significance level  Real wavelet (1 DOF)    Complex wavelet (2 DOF)

    I would like to thank Jack Ireland and Renaud Dussurget for their 
    attentive eyes, feedback and debugging.
